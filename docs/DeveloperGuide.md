### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png"/>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp//tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model` and their respective `Booking` objects.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* A `Person` has a `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, and may have 0 or any number of `Tag`s or `Booking`s.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png"/>

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### **Design Choices**

#### Find Command

##### **Aspect: Where to Perform Input Validation**
- **Alternative 1:** Validate parameters in `ClientContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
  - *Pros:* Keeps `FindCommandParser` simpler.
  - *Cons:* Predicate becomes responsible for input correctness instead of filtering logic.
- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Validate in `FindCommandParser` before predicate creation.
  - *Pros:* Ensures only valid data reaches the model layer.
  - *Cons:* Slightly increases parser complexity.

**Chosen Approach:**
Validation is performed in `FindCommandParser` for better separation of concerns — parsing vs filtering.


##### **Aspect: Handling Multiple Prefixes**
- **Alternative 1:** Search for results using a logical **AND** operation making search results more accurate and  easy to find specific team members
- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Search for results   using a logical **OR** operation to include as many results as possible to ensure user does not miss / mismatch any inputs and intended results
  - *Pros:* Easier to find groups of people even with mismatched input (e.g. `find n/Alex Loh` returns results for `Alex Yeoh` and `Brian Loh`)
  - *Cons:* Inability to find specific people among team members with similar names (e.g. When rearching for `Alex Yeoh` with a `teamLead` tag among mutiple `Alex Yeoh`s, doing `find n/Alex Yeoh t/teamLead` will list all results for both search parameters)

**Chosen Approach:**
`find` supports combining multiple prefixes using a logical **OR** relationship.
  - e.g., `find n/Alex t/friend` returns persons whose name *contains "Alex"* **or** those who have the tag *"friend"*.
- This makes it easier to find for users.


##### **Aspect: Command Format**
- **Alternative 1** Prefix before every value (current choice):
  - Example: `find t/teamLead t/friends`
  - Rationale: explicit field specifiers make tokenization deterministic, avoid ambiguity between multi-word values and separate parameters, and force deliberate searches (users must consciously mark each search term with its field).
- **Alternative 2** Implicit multiple parameters without repeated prefixes:
  - Example: `find t/ teamLead friends`
  - Rationale: more concise for users but requires heuristics to decide whether `friends` is part of the first name or a separate name; complicates tokenizer and increases chance of surprising behavior for users.

**Chosen approach:**
Prefix before every value. It trades a small amount of typing for predictable parsing, maintainable code, and fewer surprising edge cases during tokenization and validation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed Features**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### \[Proposed\] Reschedule Booking

#### Proposed Implementation

The reschedule mechanism allows users to update the datetime of an existing booking. It interacts with the **Model** and **Booking** classes to ensure no conflicts occur.

**Operations:**

  - `Model#rescheduleBooking(Booking booking, LocalDateTime newDateTime)` — Updates the booking with a new datetime after validation.
  - `Booking#setDateTime(LocalDateTime newDateTime)` — Updates the datetime field of a booking.
  - Optional undo support: Track changes in `VersionedAddressBook` to allow undo/redo of reschedules.


#### Usage Scenario

1.  The user views all bookings and identifies one to reschedule (e.g., a booking for Carl Kurz).

2.  Executes the command:

    ```
     reschedule n/Carl Kurz b/2 dt/2025-10-25 14:00
    ```

    Where:

    `b/2` = booking ID

    `n/Carl Kurz` = team member name (added for clarity and verification)

    `dt/2025-10-25 14:00` = new datetime

    The Logic component parses the command and calls:

    ```
     model.rescheduleBooking(selectedBooking, newDateTime);
    ```

    The **Model** validates:

      - The booking exists (using `b/2`).
      - The team member name (`n/`) matches the team member in booking `b/2`.
      - The new datetime does not conflict with other bookings for the same team member.
      - All parameters are valid (non-null, proper format).

    If validation passes, the booking datetime is updated. Otherwise, an error is thrown (e.g., team member mismatch, conflict, or invalid date).

    The **Logic** component returns a `CommandResult` to the UI:

      - **Success Example:**

        ```
        Booking rescheduled successfully: Carl Kurz, new datetime: 2025-10-25 14:00
        ```

      - **Failure Example:** Appropriate error message. <br>
    
    <img src="images/RescheduleDiagram.png"/> <br>
    
    **Sequence Diagram for Reschedule Command**

#### Design Considerations

**Conflict Detection:**

  - Ensure the updated datetime does not conflict with other bookings for the same team member.
  - Conflicts prevent the reschedule.

**Undo/Redo Support:**

  - Optional integration with **VersionedAddressBook**.
  - Call `Model#commitAddressBook()` after a successful reschedule.

**Parameter Validation:**

  - Booking ID exists.
  - Team member name (`n/`) matches the name in the booking. (New consideration)

----

### \[Proposed\] Edit Booking Clients/Description

#### Proposed Implementation

The edit booking mechanism allows users to update the client name or description of an existing booking without changing the datetime. This provides flexibility for booking management.

**Operations:**

  - `Model#editBooking(Booking booking, String newClientName, String newDescription)` — Updates the booking with new client name and/or description.
  - `Booking#setClientName(String newClientName)` — Updates the client name field of a booking.
  - `Booking#setDescription(String newDescription)` — Updates the description field of a booking.



#### Usage Scenario

1.  The user views all bookings and identifies one to edit (e.g., a booking for Carl Kurz).

2.  Executes the command:

    ```
     editbooking n/Carl Kurz b/2 c/Madam Wong desc/Updated consultation details
    ```

    Where:

    `b/2` = booking ID

    `n/Carl Kurz` = team member name (for verification)

    `c/Madam Wong` = new client name

    `desc/Updated consultation details` = new description

    The Logic component parses the command and calls:

    ```
     model.editBooking(selectedBooking, newClientName, newDescription);
    ```

    The **Model** validates:

      - The booking exists (using booking ID).
      - The team member name (`n/`) matches the team member in the booking.
      - At least one field (client name or description) is provided for update.
      - All parameters are valid (non-null, proper format).

    If validation passes, the booking details are updated. Otherwise, an error is thrown.

    The **Logic** component returns a `CommandResult` to the UI:

      - **Success Example:**

        ```
        Booking updated successfully: Carl Kurz, Client: Madam Wong, Description: Updated consultation details
        ```

      - **Failure Example:** Appropriate error message.

    <img src="images/EditBookingProposedSequence.png"/> <br>
    
    **Sequence Diagram for Edit Booking Command**


#### Design Considerations

**Field Validation:**

  - Client name must follow the same validation rules as new bookings.
  - Description must follow the same validation rules as new bookings.
  - At least one field must be provided for update.

**Undo/Redo Support:**

  - Integration with **VersionedAddressBook**.
  - Call `Model#commitAddressBook()` after a successful edit.

**Atomicity:**

  - Edit booking is **all-or-nothing**: either fully applied or not applied at all.

#### Extensions / Error Cases

  - **Booking does not exist:**
    Error: "Booking ID not found"

  - **No fields to update:**
    Error: "At least one field (client name or description) must be provided for update"

  - **Invalid client name:**
    Error: "Invalid client name format"

  - **Invalid description:**
    Error: "Invalid description format"

  - **Team member mismatch:**
    Error: "Team member name does not match the booking"

---

### \[Proposed\] Timezone Support

#### Proposed Implementation

The timezone mechanism allows users to work with bookings across different timezones, making the application suitable for global teams and clients.

**Operations:**

  - `Model#setUserTimezone(ZoneId timezone)` — Sets the user's preferred timezone.
  - `Booking#getDateTimeInTimezone(ZoneId timezone)` — Returns booking datetime converted to specified timezone.
  - `Booking#createBookingWithTimezone(String clientName, LocalDateTime datetime, String description, ZoneId timezone)` — Creates booking with timezone awareness.


#### Usage Scenario

1.  The user sets their preferred timezone: `settimezone Asia/Singapore` <br>
    <img src="images/TimeZoneSetTimeZoneSequence.png"/> <br>

    **Sequence Diagram for Setting Preferred Timezone**


2.  The user creates a booking: `book dt/2025-09-20 10:30 c/Madam Chen n/Bob Lee` <br>

    The system stores the booking in the user's timezone and can display it in other timezones when needed. <br>
    <img src="images/TimeZoneCreateBookingSequence.png"/> <br>

    **Sequence Diagram for Creating Booking with Timezone Preferences**


3.  The user views bookings in a different timezone: `settimezone timezone America/New_York` <br>

    All booking times are automatically converted and displayed in the specified timezone. <br>
    <img src="images/TimeZoneViewDiffTimezoneSequence.png"/> <br>

    **Sequence Diagram for Viewing Bookings in Different Timezone**


#### Design Considerations

**Timezone Storage:**

  - Store all booking datetimes in UTC internally.
  - Convert to user's preferred timezone for display.
  - Allow temporary timezone switching for viewing.

**User Preferences:**

  - Store user's default timezone in `UserPrefs`.
  - Allow timezone changes without affecting existing bookings.
  - Provide timezone validation and error handling.

**Display Format:**

  - Show timezone information in booking displays.
  - Provide clear indication when times are converted.
  - Support multiple timezone formats (e.g., UTC+8, Asia/Singapore).

**Data Migration:**

  - Existing bookings without timezone information default to UTC.
  - Provide migration tools for existing data.
  - Maintain backward compatibility.

#### Extensions / Error Cases

  - **Invalid timezone:**
    Error: "Invalid timezone format. Use format like 'Asia/Singapore' or 'UTC+8'"

  - **Timezone not found:**
    Error: "Timezone not recognized. Please use a valid timezone identifier"

  - **Conversion errors:**
    Error: "Unable to convert datetime to specified timezone"

  - **Missing timezone:**
    Error: "Please set your preferred timezone using 'settimezone' command"

---

### \[Proposed\] Find Booking

#### Proposed Implementation

Highlights relevant bookings to users searching by client name using `find`.

**Operations:**

  - `Model#markBookings(Predicate<Person> predicate)` — Mark all relevant bookings that match search criteria
  - `UI#highlightBookings()` — Highlights all relevant bookings

#### Usage Scenario

1.  The user uses `find` command to search for bookings under a specific client: `find c/Mr Tan` <br>
    <img src="images/FindBookingbyClientProposedSequence.png"/> <br>

    **Sequence Diagram for Finding Booking by Client Name**

#### Design Considerations

**Display Format:**

-  Provide clear indication to the relevant bookings by shifting it to the top of the booking list and with a highlight.
-  Only list contacts with the search criteria.
-  Ensure that all other bookings under the same contact are still present.

**Booking Storage:**

-  Ensure that the contents of the booking lists are not modified.
-  Uses a copy of the list of booking to modify the display sequence.

#### Extensions/ Error Cases

 - **Date not found:**
    Error: "No bookings with the input date found."

 - **Person not found:**
    Error: "No searches matching the input name found"
